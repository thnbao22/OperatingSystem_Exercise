# OperatingSystem_Exercise
This repository contains my answer to some question in the book named "Operating System Concepts, Tenth Edition"

4.22
Write a multithreaded program that calculates various statistical values
for a list of numbers. This program will be passed a series of numbers
on the command line and will then create three separateworker threads.
One thread will determine the average of the numbers, the second will
determine the maximum value, and the third will determine the minimum
value. For example, suppose your program is passed the integers
90 81 78 95 79 72 85
The program will report
The average value is 82
The minimum value is 72
The maximum value is 95
The variables representing the average, minimum, andmaximum values
will be stored globally. The worker threads will set these values, and
the parent thread will output the values once the workers have exited.
(We could obviously expand this program by creating additional threads
that determine other statistical values, such as median and standard
deviation.)


4.23
Write a multithreaded program that outputs prime numbers. This program
should work as follows: The user will run the program and will
enter a number on the command line. The program will then create a
separate thread that outputs all the prime numbers less than or equal to
the number entered by the user.
